# Token Airdrop Script

This Python script automates the process of sending token airdrops to a list of Solana wallet addresses. It reads wallet addresses and corresponding token amounts from a text file, performs the token transfers, and logs the transactions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Solana CLI (`spl-token` command)
- [Add any other requirements if applicable]

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the Solana CLI installed.

## Choose between Single Value Whitelist style airdrop or different amounts airdrop
For Whitelist style use whitelist_airdrop.py and edit Whitelist_airdrop.txt
For Different amounts airdrop use airdrop_amount.py and edit airdrop_amount_list
*Make sure to change the token address*

2. Edit the text file (`airdrop_amount_list.txt`) with a list of wallet addresses and token amounts in the format `wallet_address, amount`.
3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python airdrop_amount.py
    ```

4. The script will read the input file, perform token transfers, and log the transactions.
5. View the transaction log in the `output_log.txt` file.


## Configuration
- Modify the token address.
- Modify the script as needed, especially the Solana CLI command parameters.
- Adjust the cooldown period (`time.sleep(15)`) if necessary. 

## Notes

- Ensure sufficient funds are available in the funding wallet (`H6Jz41jUjNV7kNDBQuvJqNnpEYhGF6wJ5DR8bMLZDqvR`) .
- This script captures local command execution status; additional checks for blockchain confirmation are recommended.
